## "Conventional Wisdom"
	- assumptions based on simply "that's the way it's always been done" rather than data
	- Look at actual data
	- 

## Classics
	### Three Clicks of Destiny
		- In study, failed tasks has as many clicks as successful ones
		- Unsatisfied users clicked as often as satisfied ones
		- number of clicks isn't relevant, ease of finding info is
			- Is path to goal clear
			- complaining about clicks is only a symptom of poor info structure
		- ** should be clear where you've been, where you are, where you're going **

	### FOLD
		- there is no fold
		- perpetuated by printed, static design comps
		- you can prioritize content, but makes no sense to draw a line
		- In study, only 3/800 folks didn't try to scroll
			-because false footer
		- people scroll so don't worry about it
		- see super successful sites that are long
		- tell story with your content
		- mobile first design, you have to scroll. The web is amorphic
		- discourage endless scroll, feels like unwinnable game

	### Faceted Navigation
		- Feeling like you have to put navigation in one category only?
			- e.g. if a link can go in two categories, arguiing over which one instead of putting in both?

		- Nav and Let Nav
			- Endeca - service to spread info across categories
		- Is this like thinking of data relationally instead of heirarchically? "tags?"

		- Freedom of choice
			- search patterns
			- preference/mood
			- balance breadth and depth

		- Search and tags and browse

	### Hitchiker's Guide to the Homepage
		- Homepage == design
		- this is like people looking for final design in wireframe... just old, uninformed way of thinking
		- problem because it's not the design, it's just the root node
		- also, people don't only come into website from homepage
		- it's not about homepage, it's about the content that's in the site
		- Instead, design the parts that will be most frequently used, like format of blog posts or navigations
		- ** Content-First **
		- see XKCD for uni website
		- homepage really is just something to show at /
		- compare bounce rate of redesign to historic rate to check work
		- Like GM for RP - make it clear what you can do next
			- maybe for TT - [Buy a Door] [Become a Partner] or [Sell Doors]
		- Create a visual heirarchy
			- READ THIS (now this)
		- Brand statement - we are X, we do Y
		
	### Lost in White Space
		- FILL IN ALL THE SPACE AUUGHHGHGHG
		- big problem in "design by committee"
		- related to page fold myth, smashes space

		- Space is a design tool
		-
