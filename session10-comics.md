- Sequential art

## Aesthetic
	- graphic design principles
	- or C.R.A.H.P.
		- contrast
			- not just color, but shape and size
		- repetition
			- establishing a pattern
			- repeat colors to signal different "sections"
		- alignment
			- element belong together
			- like meter in poetry?
			- can deliberately break at times for different effects
		- proximity
			- group things by space
		- Hierarchy
			- Look at this first, then that second
			- levels

## Intention
	- In our culture we go left-to-right, top-to-bottom
	- "Design is the rendering of intent" -jared spool
	- the scent
	- When everything is exciting, nothing is exciting!!
	- Brad says "Do the expected in an unexpected way"
		- such as hamburger to x

## Interaction
	- wireframes don't show interaction, they just kind of define features
		- like a movie script, just outlines certain points
	- 


## takeaways
	- information without attention
		- no info
		- info without you realizing
		- explicit info you realize
