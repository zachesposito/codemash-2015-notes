# UX Toolbelt for Developers

## What is
	- ISO says it's before, during, and after
	- Before - expectations
	- After - what user thinks happened

	- Factors that can affect:
		- emotions
		- beliefs
		- preferences
		- perceptions
		- physical & psych responses

	- UX IS NOT UI
		- UX is more like the strategy for shaping what it's like to use your project
		- See Dan Willis umbrella talk

	- ** Convenience + Design - Cost = User Experience **

	- Devs should care because... the whole point of making software is to make people's lives easier

## How do
	### Analyze
		- figure out problem and best solution
		- research users, interview, visit
		- Gather requirements in terms EVERYONE understands

	### Brainstorm
		- Mind maps?
			- Associative diagrams, articulate all options or all the constituent ideas of something
			- e.g. FreeMind
			- helps make sure you're considering everything

	### Personas
		- fictional chars based on real users
		- composites of research
		- Billy Bob the User
		- Eric Meyer - crisis persona. His talk Designing for Crises
		- Good to think of a specific person for empathy, easier to keep them in mind

	### Features & Requirements Gathering
		- From brainstorming, group into features
		- Use features to set target, e.g. write tests
		- Use gherkin syntax?
			- see examples, basically feature > description, scenarios > conditions
			- given-when-then

		- Good because it bridges the gap between business and tech teams
		- Tools include SpecFlow (.NET), Cucumber (Ruby)

	### Design
		- Things that need visual designing:
			- UI
			- interaction design
			- accessibility experiences
			- prototyping
			- processes/workflows
				- flowchart it out
			- Tools: Balsamiq, Wireframes.org, Pencil, ** Dia **

		- Trick with wireframes is make sure it is clear this is layout only. Way too easy for clients to get hung up on the look at this stage

		- Don't just lorem ipsum, use ipsum generator that relates to what the content will actually be. For example, a bunch of flower names

	### Implement
		- Keep it simple

	### Testing
		- not only "is the code working", but "is the application solving the problem"
		- User focus groups, combined with heat maps, analytics
	




## Review
	- I really think we need to stop enforcing such a division between dev and design. Doing so leaves a no man's land that needs to be bridged over and over
